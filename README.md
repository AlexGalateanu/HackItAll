# HackItAll Hackathon Project: BCR Bank Reservations

Welcome to the GitHub repository of our project for the HackItAll hackathon. This project is a user-friendly website designed for BCR (Banca Comercială Română) users, allowing them to conveniently make bank reservations based on their specific needs. Additionally, it helps users locate the closest banks in their area without the need to disclose their exact location.

## Features

- Bank Reservations: Users can schedule visits to their bank according to their convenience and requirements.
- Find Nearby Banks: The website provides a functionality to list the closest banks without asking for user’s precise location.
- Email Verification: Integrates EmailJS for secure and reliable email verification during user registration or reservation confirmation.
- Bank Database: Utilizes a comprehensive database of banks which is managed and queried using Node.js, ensuring efficient data handling.

## Project Status

This project was developed as part of a hackathon and is currently not being actively maintained or developed further.

## How It Works

1. User Registration/Login: Users can register or log into the website. During registration, they will receive a verification email through EmailJS to ensure their email is valid.
2. Making a Reservation: After logging in, users can select their desired date and time for a bank visit. The website then schedules the reservation accordingly.
3. Finding Banks: Users can view a list of nearby banks. The list is generated based on general location data, ensuring user privacy.
